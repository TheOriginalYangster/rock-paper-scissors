# rock-paper-scissors

# Goal
Create a browser game in two days. This is the result! <br>
<a href="https://theoriginalyangster-rps.herokuapp.com/">Try it out here.</a>

# Tech
React app served with a Node.js/Express server both using Socket.io.

# The Good
It's fun to play!  The game works on a 'cadance' and has a realistic rock, paper, scissors feel to it.<br>
Can use it to settle disputes over Slack, Discord, etc.  You and a coworker can't decide on where to go for lunch and on different floors?  No problem.  Your friend wants to play Mordou and you want to play Counter-Strike?  You can now decide with your virtual hands.<br>
Looks great on 15' Macbooks.<br>

# The Could Be Better
Currently only handles two players, game malfunctions when multiple people try to play.  May come back and implement a room feature later.<br>
CSS is not formatted for smaller/mobile screens.<br>
The code is a little cluttered/hacky.  Things that could be seperated into seperate React components are just slapped into a heap of conditional renders.

#TODO
<ul>
<li>Seperate game states into different components</li>
<li>Create game rooms, allowing for multiple games to be played simultaniously</li>
<li>Fix CSS issues</li>
</ul>
