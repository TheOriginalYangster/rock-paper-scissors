# Goal
Create a browser game in two days. This is the result!

# Tech
React app served with a Node.js/Express server both using Socket.io.

# The Good
It's fun to play!  The game works on a 'cadance' and has a realistic rock, paper, scissors feel to it.
Can use it to settle disputes over Slack, Discord, etc.  Can't decide on where to go for lunch and your coworker is on a different floor?  No problem.  Your friend wants to play Mordou and you want to play Counter-Strike?  Settle it with your virtual hand.
CSS wise, it looks good on 15' Macbooks.
Lots of different states and slick looking loading and playing screens.

# The Could Be Better
Currently only handles two players, game malfunctions when multiple people try to play.  May come back and implement a room feature later.
It is playable on mobile but the CSS messes up.  Also messes up on different screen resolutions.  Playable, but not pretty.
The code is a little cluttered/hacky.  Things that could be seperated into seperate React components are just slapped into a heap of conditional renders.
